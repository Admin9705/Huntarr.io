## Overview

Huntarr-Sonarr continuously searches your Sonarr library for:
1. Shows with missing episodes
2. Episodes that need quality upgrades

It automatically triggers searches while being gentle on your indexers, helping you complete your collection with the best available quality.

## How It Works

1. **Initialization**: Connects to your Sonarr instance and analyzes your library
2. **Missing Content**: 
   - Identifies items with missing episodes
   - Randomly or sequentially selects items to process (configurable)
   - Refreshes metadata (optional) and triggers searches
   - Skips items with future release dates (configurable)
3. **Quality Upgrades**:
   - Finds items that don't meet your quality cutoff settings
   - Processes them in configurable batches
   - Uses smart pagination to handle large libraries
   - Can operate in random or sequential mode (configurable)
   - Skips items with future release dates (configurable)
4. **State Management**:
   - Tracks which items have been processed
   - Stores this information persistently in the `/config` volume
   - Automatically resets this tracking after a configurable time period
5. **Repeat Cycle**: Waits for a configurable period before starting the next cycle

## Configuration Options

|---------------------|---------|-------------|
| API_KEY | (Required) | Your Sonarr API key |
| API_URL | http://localhost:8989 | URL to your Sonarr instance |
| API_TIMEOUT | 60 | Timeout for API requests in seconds |

### Viewing Logs

To view the logs, simply run:

```bash
docker logs huntarr-sonarr
```

### Running Manually

If you want to run Huntarr-Sonarr manually, you can enter the container and run:

```bash
huntarr-sonarr
```

This will start the process with output directly to the console.

## Persistent Storage

Huntarr stores all its configuration and state information in persistent storage, ensuring your settings and processed state are maintained across container restarts and updates.

### Storage Locations

The following directories are used for persistent storage:

- `/config/stateful/` - Contains the state tracking files for processed items

### Data Persistence

All data in these directories is maintained across container restarts. This means:

1. The list of items that have already been processed will be maintained
2. After a container update or restart, Huntarr will continue from where it left off

### Volume Mapping

To ensure data persistence, make sure you map the `/config` directory to a persistent volume on your host system:

```bash
-v /path/to/config:/config
```

This mapping is included in all of the installation examples above.

## Installation Methods

### Docker Run

```bash
docker run -d --name huntarr-sonarr \
  --restart always \
  -v /path/to/config:/config \
  -e API_KEY=your-sonarr-api-key \
  -e API_URL=http://sonarr:8989 \
  -e MONITORED_ONLY=true \
  -e HUNT_MISSING_SHOWS=1 \
  -e HUNT_UPGRADE_EPISODES=0 \
  -e SLEEP_SECONDS=1800 \
  -e STATE_RESET_HOURS=168 \
  -e RANDOM_MISSING=true \
  -e RANDOM_UPGRADES=true \
  -e SKIP_FUTURE_EPISODES=true \
  -e SKIP_SERIES_REFRESH=true \
  -e COMMAND_WAIT_SECONDS=1 \
  -e COMMAND_WAIT_ATTEMPTS=600 \
  -e MINIMUM_DOWNLOAD_QUEUE_SIZE=-1 \
  -e LOG_EPISODE_ERRORS=false \
  -e DEBUG_API_CALLS=false \
  huntarr/4sonarr:latest
```

### Docker Compose

Create a `docker-compose.yml` file:

```yaml
version: "3.8"
services:
  huntarr-sonarr:
    image: huntarr/4sonarr:latest
    container_name: huntarr-sonarr
    restart: unless-stopped
    volumes:
      - /path/to/config:/config

Then run:

```bash
docker-compose up -d
```

### Unraid Users

For Unraid users, you can install Huntarr-Sonarr using the Community Applications plugin:

1. Open the Unraid web interface and navigate to the **Apps** tab
2. Search for "Huntarr" or "Huntarr-Sonarr" in the search box
3. Click on the Huntarr-Sonarr app
4. Fill in the following settings:
   - **Container Name**: huntarr-sonarr
   - **Host Path 1**: Choose a path for persistent storage, e.g., `/mnt/user/appdata/huntarr-sonarr`
   - Set your environment variables:
     - API_KEY: your-sonarr-api-key
     - API_URL: http://tower:8989 (replace "tower" with your Sonarr container name or IP)
     - Other variables as desired
5. Click **Apply** to create the container

Alternatively, you can add the container manually via the **Docker** tab:

1. Click **Add Container** in the Docker tab
2. Enter the following details:
   - **Name**: huntarr-sonarr
   - **Repository**: huntarr/4sonarr:latest
   - Add a path mapping: `/config` to `/mnt/user/appdata/huntarr-sonarr`
   - Add the environment variables as listed above
3. Click **Apply** to create the container

## Use Cases

- **Library Completion**: Gradually fill in missing content in your media library
- **Quality Improvement**: Automatically upgrade item quality as better versions become available
- **New Item Setup**: Automatically find media for newly added items
- **Background Service**: Run it in the background to continuously maintain your library
- **Smart Rotation**: With state tracking, ensures all content gets attention over time
- **Disk Usage Optimization**: Skip refreshing metadata to reduce disk wear and tear
- **Efficient Searching**: Skip processing items with future release dates to save resources
- **Stateful Operation**: Maintain processing state across container restarts and updates

## Tips

- **API Connection**: Make sure your API_KEY and API_URL are correct
- **Adjusting Speed**: Lower the SLEEP_SECONDS to search more frequently (be careful with indexer limits)
- **Batch Size Control**: Adjust HUNT_MISSING_SHOWS and HUNT_UPGRADE_EPISODES values based on your indexer's rate limits
- **Monitored Status**: Set MONITORED_ONLY to false if you want to download all missing content regardless of monitored status
- **System Resources**: The application uses minimal resources and can run continuously on even low-powered systems
- **Hard Drive Saving**: Enable SKIP_SERIES_REFRESH to reduce disk activity
- **Search Efficiency**: Keep SKIP_FUTURE_EPISODES enabled to avoid searching for unavailable content
- **Persistent Storage**: Make sure to map the `/config` volume to preserve state information
- **Random vs Sequential**: Configure RANDOM_MISSING and RANDOM_UPGRADES based on your preference for processing style

## Troubleshooting

- **API Key Issues**: Check that your API_KEY is correct
- **Connection Problems**: Ensure the API_URL is accessible from where you're running the application
- **Logs**: Check the container logs with `docker logs huntarr-sonarr`
- **Settings Not Persisting**: Verify your volume mount for `/config` is configured correctly
- **State Files**: The application stores state in `/config/stateful/` - if something seems stuck, you can try deleting these files
- **Excessive Disk Activity**: If you notice high disk usage, try enabling SKIP_SERIES_REFRESH

This application helps automate the tedious process of finding missing content and quality upgrades in your media collection, running quietly in the background while respecting your indexers' rate limits.
