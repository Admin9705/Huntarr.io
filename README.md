## Overview

This script continually searches your Sonarr library for shows with missing episodes and automatically triggers searches for those missing episodes. It's designed to run continuously while being gentle on your indexers, helping you gradually complete your TV show collection.

## Features

- üîÑ **Continuous Operation**: Runs indefinitely until manually stopped
- üéØ **Direct Missing Episode Targeting**: Directly identifies and processes only shows with missing episodes
- üé≤ **Random Selection**: By default, selects shows randomly to distribute searches across your library
- ‚è±Ô∏è **Throttled Searches**: Includes configurable delays to prevent overloading indexers
- üìä **Status Reporting**: Provides clear feedback about what it's doing and which shows it's searching for
- üõ°Ô∏è **Error Handling**: Gracefully handles connection issues and API failures

## How It Works

1. **Initialization**: Connects to your Sonarr instance and retrieves a list of shows with missing episodes
2. **Selection Process**: Randomly selects a show with missing episodes from the filtered list
3. **Refresh**: Refreshes the metadata for the selected show
4. **Search Trigger**: Uses the MissingEpisodeSearch command to instruct Sonarr to search for missing episodes
5. **Throttling**: After processing a show, it pauses for a configurable amount of time
6. **Cycling**: After processing the configured number of shows, it starts a new cycle, refreshing the data

## Configuration Options

The following environment variables can be configured:

# Environment Variables

The following environment variables can be configured:

| Variable                     | Description                                                           | Default    |
|------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------|------------|
| `API_KEY`                    | Your Sonarr API key                                                   | Required   |
| `API_URL`                    | URL to your Sonarr instance                                           | Required   |
| `MONITORED_ONLY`             | Only process monitored shows/episodes                                 | true       |
| `SEARCH_TYPE`                | Which search to perform: `"missing"`, `"upgrade"`, or `"both"`         | both       |
| `MAX_MISSING`                | Maximum missing shows to process per cycle                            | 1          |
| `MAX_UPGRADES`               | Maximum upgrade episodes to process per cycle                         | 10         |
| `SLEEP_DURATION`             | Seconds to wait after completing a cycle (900 = 15 minutes)           | 900        |
| `RANDOM_SELECTION`           | Use random selection (`true`) or sequential (`false`)                 | true       |
| `STATE_RESET_INTERVAL_HOURS` | Hours after which the processed state files are reset                 | 24         |

### EXTRA ENVIORNMNETAL NOTES

- **SEARCH_TYPE**  
  - Determines which type of search the script performs.  
  - Options:  
    - `"missing"`: Only processes missing shows (episodes that haven‚Äôt been downloaded yet).  
    - `"upgrade"`: Only processes episodes that need quality upgrades (do not meet the quality cutoff).  
    - `"both"`: First processes missing shows and then processes upgrade episodes in one cycle.

- **MAX_MISSING**  
  - Sets the maximum number of missing shows to process in each cycle.  
  - Once this limit is reached, the script stops processing further missing shows until the next cycle.

- **MAX_UPGRADES**  
  - Sets the maximum number of upgrade episodes to process in each cycle.  
  - When this limit is reached, the upgrade portion of the cycle stops and the script waits for the next cycle.

- **STATE_RESET_INTERVAL_HOURS**  
  - Controls how often the script "forgets" which items it has already processed.  
  - The script records the IDs of missing shows and upgrade episodes that have been processed.  
  - When the age of these records exceeds the number of hours set by this variable, the records are cleared automatically.  
  - This reset allows the script to re-check items that were previously processed, so if there are changes (such as improved quality or new episodes), they can be processed again.  
  - In simple terms: if you set this to 24, then every 24 hours the script will start fresh and re-check everything, ensuring nothing is permanently skipped.

## Installation Methods

### Docker Run

The simplest way to run Sonarr Hunter is via Docker:

```bash
docker run -d --name sonarr-hunter \
  --restart always \
  -e API_KEY="your-api-key" \
  -e API_URL="http://your-sonarr-address:8989" \
  -e MONITORED_ONLY="true" \
  -e SEARCH_TYPE="both" \
  -e MAX_MISSING="1" \
  -e MAX_UPGRADES="10" \
  -e SLEEP_DURATION="900" \
  -e RANDOM_SELECTION="true" \
  -e STATE_RESET_INTERVAL_HOURS="24" \
  admin9705/sonarr-hunter:latest
```

### Docker Compose

For those who prefer Docker Compose, add this to your `docker-compose.yml` file:

```yaml
version: "3.8"
services:
  sonarr-hunter:
    image: admin9705/sonarr-hunter:latest
    container_name: sonarr-hunter
    restart: always
    environment:
      API_KEY: "your-api-key"
      API_URL: "http://your-sonarr-address:8989"
      MONITORED_ONLY: "true"
      SEARCH_TYPE: "both"
      MAX_MISSING: "1"
      MAX_UPGRADES: "10"
      SLEEP_DURATION: "900"
      RANDOM_SELECTION: "true"
      STATE_RESET_INTERVAL_HOURS: "24"
```

Then run:

```bash
docker-compose up -d sonarr-hunter
```

To check on the status of the program, you should see new files downloading or you can type:
```bash
docker logs sonarr-hunter
```

### Unraid Users

1. Install the plugin called `UserScripts`
2. Copy and paste the following script file as a new script - [sonarr-hunter.sh](sonarr-hunter.sh) 
3. Ensure to set it to `Run in the background` if your array is already running and set the schedule to `At Startup Array`

### SystemD Service

For a more permanent installation on Linux systems using SystemD:

1. Save the script to `/usr/local/bin/sonarr-hunter.sh`
2. Make it executable: `chmod +x /usr/local/bin/sonarr-hunter.sh`
3. Create a systemd service file at `/etc/systemd/system/sonarr-hunter.service`:

```ini
[Unit]
Description=Sonarr Hunter Service
After=network.target sonarr.service

[Service]
Type=simple
User=your-username
Environment="API_KEY=your-api-key"
Environment="API_URL=http://localhost:8989"
Environment="MONITORED_ONLY=true"
Environment="SEARCH_TYPE=both"
Environment="MAX_MISSING=1"
Environment="MAX_UPGRADES=10"
Environment="SLEEP_DURATION=900"
Environment="RANDOM_SELECTION=true"
Environment="STATE_RESET_INTERVAL_HOURS=24"
ExecStart=/usr/local/bin/sonarr-hunter.sh
Restart=on-failure
RestartSec=10

[Install]
WantedBy=multi-user.target
```

4. Enable and start the service:

```bash
sudo systemctl enable sonarr-hunter
sudo systemctl start sonarr-hunter
```

## Use Cases

- **Library Completion**: Gradually fill in missing episodes of TV shows
- **New Show Setup**: Automatically find episodes for newly added shows
- **Background Service**: Run it in the background to continuously maintain your library

## Tips

- **First-Time Use**: Start with default settings to ensure it works with your setup
- **Adjusting Speed**: Lower the `SLEEP_DURATION` to search more frequently (be careful with indexer limits)
- **Multiple Shows**: Increase `MAX_SHOWS` if you want to search for more shows per cycle
- **Monitored Status**: Set `MONITORED_ONLY=false` if you want to download all missing episodes regardless of monitored status
- **System Resources**: The script uses minimal resources and can run continuously on even low-powered systems

## Troubleshooting

- **API Key Issues**: Check that your API key is correct in Sonarr settings
- **Connection Problems**: Ensure the Sonarr URL is accessible from where you're running the script
- **Command Failures**: If search commands fail, try using the Sonarr UI to verify what commands are available in your version
- **Logs**: Check the container logs with `docker logs sonarr-hunter` if running in Docker

---

**Change Log:**
- **v1**: Original code written
- **v2**: Optimized search
- **v3**: Variable names changed for docker optimization
- **v4**: Added monitored only tag

---

This script helps automate the tedious process of finding missing episodes in your TV collection, running quietly in the background while respecting your indexers' rate limits.
